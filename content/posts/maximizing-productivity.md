# Maximizing Productivity, Physical & Mental Heathl

I'm a big fan of Huberman and I'm starting to write down what I'm learning from
his videos (science based).

1. Morning light exposure
    - Description: Getting exposure to bright light in the morning, preferably
      within the first hour of waking up.
    - Usefulness: Helps regulate circadian rhythms, cortisol secretion, and
      mood.
    - Example: Walking outside, sitting near a window that receives natural light, using a light box.
2. Cool and dark bedroom for sleep
    - Description: Keeping the bedroom cool and dark to aid in falling asleep and staying asleep.
    - Usefulness: Throughout the night, there are phases of sleep where you are paralyzed, so-called REM sleep. There are portions of the night where you can move. And one of the more important movements that you do in the middle of the night is put your hand out or your foot out or you take your face out from under the covers as a means to cool yourself, and you do this while you are asleep. If you are in a cool room, you can put yourself under the blankets to stay warm, and then if you want to cool off, you can simply remove a limb or you can toss the covers off entirely.
    - Example: Keeping the thermostat at a lower temperature, using a fan, covering windows to block out light.
3. Non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) protocols
    - Description: Engaging in activities that promote deep relaxation, such as yoga nidra or sleep hypnosis, to help fall back asleep in the middle of the night.
    - Usefulness: Can help shift the mind away from anxiety and reduce rumination, making it easier to fall and stay asleep.
    - Example: Listening to a guided meditation, practicing long exhale breathing, doing gentle yoga poses.
4. Morning 90-minute work block
    - Description: Carving out 90 minutes in the morning for focused, dedicated work.
    - Usefulness: Allows for completion of important or demanding tasks early in the day, when cognitive function is typically at its highest.
    - Example: Writing a report, analyzing data, creating a presentation.
5. Afternoon 90-minute work block after NSDR
    - Description: Carving out 90 minutes in the afternoon for focused, dedicated work following a period of deep relaxation.
    - Usefulness: Allows for completion of important or demanding tasks later in the day, when cognitive function may start to decline.
    - Example: Responding to emails, making phone calls, preparing for meetings.
6. Supplements (magnesium, apigenin, theanine)
    - Description: Taking specific forms of magnesium, apigenin, and theanine to aid in falling asleep.
    - Usefulness: Magnesium promotes the release of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that shuts off the forebrain, reducing thinking, rumination, and planning. Apigenin and theanine also increase GABA levels and can help reduce anxiety and allow for deeper relaxation.
    - Example: Taking 300-400 mg of magnesium bisglycinate or threonate, 50 mg of apigenin, and 100-200 mg of theanine 30-60 minutes before sleep.
7. Bright light exposure in the evening
    - Description: Getting exposure to bright light in the evening to delay the onset of melatonin and shift the circadian rhythm.
    - Usefulness: Can be helpful for individuals who have trouble falling asleep due to a delayed melatonin pulse.
    - Example: Going for a walk outside or using bright indoor lights in the evening.
8. Regular wake-up and sleep times
    - Description: Waking up and going to bed at the same time every day.
    - Usefulness: Helps regulate circadian rhythms and promote consistent sleep quality.
    - Example: Waking up at 7 am and going to bed at 11 pm every day.
9. Weekend drift
    - Description: Allowing for some schedule variation on the weekends to recover and get additional rest.
    - Usefulness: Can help prevent burnout and promote overall well-being.
    - Example: Sleeping in an extra hour or two on the weekends, engaging in leisure activities, taking a day off from work.
10. Adaptation to personal profession or lifestyle
    - Description: Modifying the protocols to fit one's own profession or lifestyle.
    - Usefulness: Allows for customization of the protocols to optimize productivity, health, and well-being.
    - Example: If you work a night shift, adjusting the sleep and light exposure protocols to fit your schedule.
